VAS Server Coding.
There are totally two C source files. One is the 656pro_server.c and the another one is the 656pro_client.c

Fot the server:
  After compiling, there should be two parameters. one is the ip address and the another one is the port number.
For the testing client (command line client)
  There should be two parameters as well, just like the server.
